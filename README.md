# A03_5512
This repository contains the code for assignment A03. Three data sampling techniques (majority undersampling, minority oversampling, and SMOTE) were utilized in a classification NN  framework and evaluated to compare performance across models. To run this code, install all required packages and import California housing data. The script will run through each sampling technique and output a classification report and confusion matrix to evaluate model performance. To test model reproducibility, 30 test and train splits were created, resampled with the minority oversampling technique, and utilized in training the classification NN. Model runs were plotted against their accuracy score, precision score, and recall score to observe the distribution.
